# How to run

Set your current directory at a position where you could run

```bash
java miniJava.Compiler <inputfile>
```

Clone this directory, and then run `ephemeral-137/tester.sh` through bash.

i.e.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RuneBlaze/ephemeral-137
chmod +x ephemeral-137/tester.sh
./ephemeral-137/tester.sh
```

which would run the test suite
